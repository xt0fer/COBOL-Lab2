# COBOL-Lab2

1) Modify the your 'ask-name' program from Lab1 such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names

2) Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

3) Guessing game (Too Large/ Too Small)

Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
